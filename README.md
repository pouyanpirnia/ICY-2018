ICY README

=======================
Project description

ICY: an interface between COMSOL Multiphysics and discrete element code YADE for the modelling of porous media. The interface is based on a serie of JAVA classes.

The interface was first verified to simulate the terminal velocity of a sphere falling in water. The source codes are provided in the Verification folder.

The interface was then improved to model an internal or contact erosion test. The source codes are presented in the Applicationtest folder. 
=======================
